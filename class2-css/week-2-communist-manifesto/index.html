    <h1>Manifesto of the Communist Party</h1>

    <div class="karl"><img src="images/marx.png" /></div>
    
    <p>
      A spectre is haunting Europe â€” the spectre of communism. All the powers of
      old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre:
      Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German
      police-spies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic
      by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled
      back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced
      opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
    </p>
    <p>Two things result from this fact:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a
        power.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole
        world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this
        nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party
        itself.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London
      and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English,
      French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
